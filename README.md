# AI-SE-week3_Tools-F-works

## Description
This project demonstrates a classical machine learning workflow using Scikit-learn to perform classification on the Iris dataset. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training (Decision Tree Classifier), prediction, and evaluation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Papi1997/AI-SE-week3_Tools-F-works.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AI-SE-week3_Tools-F-works
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyterlab
   ```

## Usage
1. Start JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
2. Open and run the `Classical_ML_with_Scikit_learn1.ipynb` notebook.
   This notebook will:
    - Load the Iris dataset (from `Iris.csv` or `sklearn.datasets`).
    - Perform basic preprocessing.
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Train a Decision Tree Classifier.
    - Make predictions on the test set.
    - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

The `Iris.csv` file is provided in the repository and is used by the notebook.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
6. Open a Pull Request.
