# Machine Learning & NLP Models Portfolio

This repository is a showcase of various machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) projects implemented using Python. It combines classical machine learning techniques, computer vision with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and natural language processing using spaCy.

## üìÅ Included Notebooks

### 1. Classical Machine Learning with Scikit-learn
**File:** `Classical_ML_with_Scikit_learn1.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates classical machine learning models applied to a dataset using the Scikit-learn library.

**Highlights:**
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Training & testing split
- Models used:  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - Decision Trees  
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

---

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
**File:** `CNN_model.ipynb`

This notebook builds a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification using TensorFlow/Keras.

**Highlights:**
- Image loading and preprocessing
- Model architecture definition (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense)
- Model training and validation
- Visualization of accuracy and loss

### 3. Natural Language Processing with spaCy
**File:** `spacy.ipynb`

This notebook explores the use of spaCy for natural language processing tasks.

**Highlights:**
- Tokenization
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Text classification and parsing (if included)
